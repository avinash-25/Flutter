// Flutter have two types of animation  1. Physics based animation  2. Tween

// Physics based animation is used to mimic real-world behaviour. for ex when object is dropped
// and hit the ground it will bounce and continue to move forward, but with each bounce, it
// continues to slow down with smaller rebounds and eventually drop.

// Tween is short for "in-between" meaning is animation has begining and ending points,a timeline,
// and a curve that specifies the timing and speed of the transition. The beauty is that the framework
// is automatically calculates the transition from the begnining to end point

// Difference in hero and animation is in hero we have to define two page but in animation we can define
// everything at a single page.
